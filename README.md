The **Smart Helmet for Industrial Workers** enhances safety with sensors for gas detection (MQ2, MQ135), temperature &amp; humidity (DHT11), and fall detection (ADXL335, vibration sensor). It monitors conditions in real-time and sends alerts for hazards, integrating with a mobile app for remote monitoring. 🚀
# Smart Helmet for Industrial Workers  

This smart helmet enhances worker safety by monitoring environmental conditions and detecting hazards in real-time. Equipped with gas sensors (MQ2, MQ135), temperature & humidity sensor (DHT11), and fall detection (ADXL335, vibration sensor), it alerts administrators via a connected mobile app.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Gas Detection** – Identifies harmful gases using MQ2 & MQ135.  
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring** – Ensures safe working conditions with DHT11.  
- **Fall Detection** – Detects falls and impacts with ADXL335 and a vibration sensor.  
- **Real-time Alerts** – Sends notifications to administrators in case of hazards.  
- **IoT Integration** – Can be connected to a mobile app for remote monitoring.  

## 🛠️ Components Used  
- **Microcontroller:** (Specify, e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi)  
- **Sensors:** MQ2, MQ135, DHT11, ADXL335, Vibration Sensor  
- **Power Supply:** (Specify battery type, voltage, etc.)
